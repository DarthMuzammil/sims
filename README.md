# VIRTUAL WORLD
### An Experimental 3D Web Experience

![Game Preview](public/preview.gif)

## Vision

VIRTUAL WORLD is an ambitious experiment in browser-based 3D interaction. Built with modern web technologies, it explores the possibilities of creating immersive experiences directly in your browser.

### The Concept

Step into a handcrafted 3D environment where you can freely explore and interact with NPCs. Through a combination of Three.js rendering and React-powered interactions, we're pushing the boundaries of what web browsers can deliver.

### Core Experience

- Walk through a detailed 3D environment
- Engage in branching dialogues with NPCs
- Experience dynamic lighting and shadows
- Enjoy smooth, responsive controls

## Technical Foundation

Built with passion using:
- Next.js
- Three.js & React Three Fiber
- Framer Motion
- Modern WebGL

## Try It Out

### Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Controls
- WASD - Movement
- Mouse - Camera control
- E - Interact
- 1-3 - Dialogue choices

## Development Status

This is an early experimental build. Features and mechanics are actively being developed and refined. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

## Roadmap

- [ ] Enhanced NPC interactions
- [ ] Expanded environment
- [ ] Additional dialogue systems
- [ ] Performance optimizations
